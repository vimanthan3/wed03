/**
 * A registry of watch probes. A probe serves as a way to prove that a hierarchy Gradle is interested in
 * indeed receives file system events from the operating system.
 * This is to avoid trusting locations where OSs silently not send any events, despite watchers being registered.
 *
 * When the hierarchy is first registered via {@link #registerProbe(File, File)}, we don't yet create the probe.
 * That only happens when the hierarchy is actually read or written by Gradle, in which case
 * {@link org.gradle.internal.watch.registry.impl.DefaultFileWatcherProbeRegistry.WatchProbeImpl#arm()} is called.
 *
 * When the probe is armed, a probe file is created (or re-created) for the hierarchy.
 * This should cause a file system event to be produced by the operating system.
 * We listen to those events specifically in {@link FileWatcherRegistry}.
 * Once the event arrives, {@link #triggerWatchProbe(Path)} is called with the path,
 * and the probe becomes triggered (or proven).
 *
 * The {@link #unprovenHierarchies()} stream returns any hierarchies that were armed, but never received
 * a file system event.
 * These locations cannot be trusted to receive file system events in a timely manner.
 *
 * Note: a probe needs to be armed only once, if it receives an event, we will trust that location until
 * the registry is closed.
